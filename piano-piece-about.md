## Piano Piece 

#### starting place
- Multi-movement
- connected work, rather than a collection of small pieces
- variation? Contrapuntal?

###### Array section from "Settle the Score"

		|         |{027|     |9      |t568134e}|         |            |
		|         |{86 |1et3 |20     |7        |549}     |            |
		|{4986    |1et3|2075}|       |{9       |         |786et312054}|
		|         |{549|     |786et31|20}      |         |            |

This kind of array was fruitful for contrapuntal composition, as well as combing two characters-in this case diatonic and chromatic hexachord types, to which I composed as *connected* and *separated* respectively. 

In this piano piece, I am think of the kinds of 'alternation' I created in works "Settle the Score" and "Commonplace Common Tones" and implementing this idea in a multi-movement work with variety.

### Double Array

		| 9 e 1 2 4 6 8 |
		| 0 t 8 7 5 3 2 |

Two ordered diatonic sets separated by a tritone, similar to "CCT" but their orderings are different, rather than the same. Together they create a weighted aggregate with duplicated `2` and `8`.

#### Partitions of 7
There are 15 partitions of 7 in up to 7 parts.

	   x1 x2 x2 x2 x3 x3 x3 x3  4 x4 x4 x5 x5 x6  7
	    1  1  2  2  1  2  2  3  1  2  3  1  2  1
